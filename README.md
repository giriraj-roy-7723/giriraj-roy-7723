# 👋 Hi, I'm Giriraj Roy

I'm a passionate and curious **AI/ML developer**, active open-source contributor, and enthusiastic problem solver.

I enjoy building real-world, functional AI agents, participating in open-source programs like **SSoC (Script Summer of Code)**, and contributing to projects that make a real impact. Whether it's deploying intelligent systems, automating tasks, or making AI accessible through clean UI/UX, I strive to create meaningful work.

I also have hands-on experience in **full-stack development**, and I love connecting ML models with user-friendly interfaces using tools like **Streamlit** and backend technologies like **FastAPI** and **MongoDB**.

## 🚀 What I'm Working On

- 🤖 **AI Agents** that auto-apply to 200+ jobs from platforms like Internshala using LangGraph, Gemini, Playwright, FAISS, etc.
- 🧠 **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems** for generating Bengali MCQs for competitive exams.
- 🏥 **Health AI** models for disease prediction from symptoms (e.g., decision trees for diabetes, heart disease, and more).
- 🧪 Smart question generators and multilingual semantic search using **LaBSE**, **FAISS**, and **LLMs**.
- 🌐 Building full-stack AI apps using **Streamlit**, **FastAPI**, and **MongoDB**, including clean UIs and deployment-ready code.
